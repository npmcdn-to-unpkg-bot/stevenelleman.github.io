var blog_isis = "In the wake of the tragedy in Paris I have seen numerous posts expressing how the extremists who perpetrated these killings went against the teachings of Islam and were not <q>true</q> Muslims.
In the wake of the hateful things that the Westboro Baptist Church does, American Christians make it absolutely clear how the Westboro practitioners are not real Christians.
By definition Islamic means that the Quran is the emphasized sacred text. ISIS and Islamic extremists use the Quran. Christianity means that the Bible is the emphasized sacred text and the Westboro Baptist Church emphasizes the Bible. ISIS is Islamic, and the Westboro Baptist Church is Christian. 
Is this to say ISIS REPRESENTS Islam? Of course not - there are 1.3 billion Muslims in the world, and ISIS represents an extremely small fraction of Muslims. Is this to say the Westboro Baptist Church REPRESENTS Christianity? Of course not - Christianity encompasses numerous sects. Both ISIS and the Westboro Baptist Church represent extreme interpretations of the Quran and Bible respectively. 
To say ISIS is not Islamic is factually incorrect. Rather than attempting to cordon extremist groups off and rationalize how non-Islamic or non-Christian they are, we need to recognize that religion is in large part interpretation and that there are many many interpretations - most moderate but some extreme. This is more accurate and avoids fear-mongering and stereotyping - it recognizes that a particular religion does not inherently create extremists; there are extreme interpretations WITHIN ALL IDEOLOGIES (including atheism, for that matter). 
In our day and age what defines extremism is imposition of values, of violently impressing ones own values onto others. Being a moderate is simply respecting others to make their own choice. On the basis of this distinction Islamophobia describes a fear that can be applied to all ideologies, not just to one in particular.";

var blog_shootings = "<p>
My entire life I've heard men talk about something being <q>taken,</q> that they were <q>picked on</q> by others and the victim of some ambiguous assault on them. It was always white men expecting commiseration from other white men, and I was expected to chip in. As I grew up the pattern continued, comments loaded with self-pity directed at the same audience - an echo chamber for self-proclaimed victims, burdened by a shared but nameless experience.
<br><br>
Following the recent Oregon shooting I began to connect these experiences with the fact that a consistent pattern in American school shootings is that the shooter is a white male.
<br><br>
While the fallout of each shooting is a massive national argument over the status of guns, what never enters the argument is a much-needed discussion of the underlying motivation and how there is a definite pattern in these shootings. While guns are the means by which these tragedies unfold, the motivation for such acts exists with or without them; guns just enable the motivation to be expressed in an incredibly destructive way. The closest the argument gets to the question of motivation is proclaiming the shooter mentally ill. But mental illness is an excuse to dismiss the issue. There is certainly no way to understand this illness, we cannot change it, we can stop talking about it and go back to pretending there is absolutely no problem.
<br><br>
Catastrophe requires a perfect alignment of probabilities; these shootings are no different. Guns are one factor, being a young white male seems to be another (at least in the shootings discussed by the media), and some kind of satisfaction from a hyper-violent blowout is another.
<br><br>
What is a phenomena shared by white males that could account for overrepresentation in school shootings relative to population? Having family in the Southeast and having lived in Northeast and on the West Coast there is a shared sentiment among white men: something has been taken.
<br><br>
But what has been taken? What has been taken from white men that they cannot describe themselves?
<br><br>
Men have lost something. They have lost arbitrary authority - by traditional standards of masculinity they have been emasculated for a very simple reason: contraception.
<br><br>
Before contraception was accessible and acceptable, if a man and a woman were in a relationship, the woman would be having children for much of her adult life. What this meant was that men were the default provider and society was set up around that expectation, confining women to the home whether or not they were capable of economic independence. Even if a man was a complete failure, if he had a wife and children that depended on him he had power stemming from necessity. It is in this context that chivalry existed - that men at any point could do whatever they wanted to women who were fundamentally vulnerable, but chose not to. The dragon that held the damsel in distress could be found within every man: arbitrary authority enabled terrible wrongs to be committed. However, the knight could also be found within every man: self-sacrifice for those depending on his authority was the positive reality of chivalry.
<br><br>
Yes, men have lost something: the economic dependence of women.
<br><br>
Contraception did much more than enable women to control pregnancy, it enabled them to control their own economic security. Women do not need men for survival any more.
<br><br>
From this perspective is it surprising that the generation following the sexual revolution had unprecedented rates of divorce? Absolutely not. Men had not reacted to a fundamental shift in circumstances, but women could act: they could leave.
This was the death knell of traditional views on masculinity, but it is so fundamentally obvious that nobody noticed - like an object that is so close to your face that you are unable to see it in focus without backing up a few steps. But people can feel it. Below the surface people know it. 
<br><br>
No wonder popular culture has become increasingly violent, increasingly masculine; it is to fill a conspicuous absence. The causality runs in the opposite direction - hyper-violent, hyper-sexualized and hyper-masculine media is a form of compensation, an attempt to move back to ideals that no longer fit contemporary circumstances. This popular culture communicates one thing to men: die for a cause and you're nobel, you're a hero, risk your life for a cause and you'll get the girl, you're a hero. Self-sacrifice stems from the same traditional view of masculinity - the man sacrifices for those dependent on him, for women and children. Self-sacrifice was the positive reality of male authority. This message belongs to a different time, appealing to antiquated ideals that we cling to more and more desperately. It is not coincidence that superheroes - essentially all male - are so engaging and ubiquitous: they reflect our ideals for both men and women (hence the absence of female superheroes). They offer catharsis for a sentiment of loss and expectations unfulfilled. They are the knights we so desperately want to be. 
<br><br>
No wonder why gun activists are up in arms - the gun is one of the last holdouts on masculine empowerment. Losing the gun is assenting to male impotence. 
<br><br>
No wonder there has been such intense male activism in the pro-life movement. The pro-life/pro-gun bloc in the 87%-white, 80%-male Congress is not unified by life; if it was the bloc would be pro-life/anti-gun. No, it is unified by male fear of dis-empowerment - losing control over women's bodies and empowerment through arms. Both stem from a sense of masculinity lost, and fear of losing more ground.
<br><br>
No wonder this aggression is expressed through shootings, through the hyper-masculine. I belong to a generation of men who feel utterly impotent, unable to feel a sense of value through authority that in the past they could always find through the women who depended on them. And in a world in which the ratio of men to women was approximately one to one and women were not allowed to support themselves, that meant all men had authority - and a default target for externalizing their own insecurity. An incredibly pervasive theme in these shootings, occurring in almost every case, is an element of sexual frustration and female rejection. And in each case the sentiment of the shooter is the same - it's not fair, I didn't get what I deserved, something was taken. Rather than looking towards their own behavior for solutions they gravitate towards a far more appealing rationalization of events: I am the victim, but I'll show them. 
<br><br>
No wonder why each of these shootings involve a doctrine - the doctrine is a social justification for their own victimization, to guise their hyper-desperate murder-suicide blowout as a form of justified hyper-masculine self-sacrifice, absolving them of responsibility. In a society in which self-sacrifice has lost its necessary context, it exists eerily close to suicide. The public doctrine is for the shooter - it provides the necessary pretext, it outlines the wrongs committed against them and the <q>fair</q> recourse that they chose. They are the perverse hero in the tale of their own victimization, and it is a very tall tale. 
<br><br>

School shootings are one symptom of a male identity crisis.
As a man, I have a message to other men in this country: yes, something has been lost. We should be grateful it has. The positive reality of self-sacrifice and the negative reality of abuse and chauvinism followed from the inherent premise of male power and female vulnerability; a premise that was fundamentally undone by contraception. We must hold ourselves to a different standard, one in which we have to respect others properly. We are responsible for creating this new standard, rather than clinging to antiquated ideals unfit for our times. 
Are we victims? Yes, by our own hand. By subjecting ourselves to an unfair and unfit standard we have wronged ourselves. We will never be able to live up to those standards. They belong to a different time. We have a responsibility to ourselves to follow a standard for our times. 
<br><br>
Let us turn a collective tragedy into an opportunity for the ultimate atonement: change. 
<br><br>
I know where my change is starting.
<br><br>
  </p>";

var observations = "<p> In different social settings we have different ways of presenting ourselves, often to fit into the expectations of those around us. We do this so that they like us, one of the primary ways of deriving a sense of self-worth is through the approbation of others. Here are some tips for maximizing approbation while not alienating those around us. 
<br><br>
1. Don't make assumptions.
<br><br>
Making assumptions, especially about someone's ethnic or cultural origin, is one of the riskiest ways of starting off with someone. We often make this mistake because we want to impress others, but honestly the risk isn't worth it. Making a mistake is usually regarded as highly offensive and guessing correctly offers very few benefits. While asking certain questions may seem invasive or embarrassing, understanding when to give up and ask is very important when working with others. 
<br><br>
2. Make others feel important.
<br><br>
We strive for the appreciation of others. This is why we all wear masks of half-truths, masks that are adapted according to what we think others expect and want of us. While we change our presentation for others, often the other person is so involved in the same process that nobody gives the appreciation that everyone desperately wants. Wearing masks is a strange mix of self-sacrificing and egocentric; we are willing to change major aspects of ourselves to feel valuable. And when the appreciation we expect doesn't come, we wear the mask more and more desperately, willing to sacrifice more and more aspects of ourselves. This cycle can become destructive, very very easily. 
<br><br>
I prefer the opposite process, one that creates a win-win scenario. If you genuinely appreciate something that another person does, always say it. Always say nice, true things. There is no down-side. And this is exactly what others want; they just want to feel appreciated. 
<br><br>
Recently I went to Asha's Teahouse in Berkeley and I thanked the baristo for bringing joy to people through fabulous tea. After this token of appreciation, his face completely transformed. He went from tired to happy, really really happy, in a few seconds. He immediately replied <q>You're the guy!</q> I asked him what he meant. He then told me that I had done the same thing before - I had, five months before, and he remembered it. Appreciation is powerful, because it is what people so desperately want (especially in the service industry). 
<br><br>
While this process can be very powerful, you also have to watch out for negative expectations. A good example are gender expectations. Men are expected to pursue, women are expected to be pursued. It's stupid but it is the expectation. What this means is that there are opposite biases - guys being nice to women are suspected of ulterior motive (it's fair enough, too), and women being nice to men are seen as teases. When making someone of the opposite gender important, understanding this bias becomes quite important. Very few people actually appreciate others, so when someone does others are initially suspicious. 
<br><br>
In other situations the bias can be used for your benefit. For instance, in environments with a hierarchy perceived inferiors are typically treated like crap by perceived superiors. Superiors who do this not only are massively insecure but are missing a chance to win major brownie points. It's my impression that these superiors don't actually feel superior so they have to beat up underlings to prove their authority - prove it to themselves. A superior who knows they are an authority does not need to treat their underlings like crap - it fundamentally doesn't help anyone. But as this is the expectation, if a perceived superior is decent to perceived inferiors, that decency is amplified by the negative expectation. I have had so many amazing conversation and experiences with cab/uber drivers, homeless folks, and service workers because I treated them like equals in a situation in which they expected to be treated like inferiors. 
<br><br>
3. Start with commonalities, work to differences.
<br><br>
Human interactions can be seen in terms of energy barriers. We only meet new people if the energy barrier is lowered by what we can get from the interaction - the person may look interesting, they may be beautiful, they may have a nice smile. These all help lower the barrier. In conversations the best way of lowering the barrier is by targeting commonalities. By finding commonalities you make the other person more invested in the conversation. Another major barrier is lack of trust, when you establish commonalities and establish more credibility you can then move to away from commonalities to differences. Differences require more tact because there is potential for confrontation. So when I discuss differences I'm usually prepared to fall on my sword - I would prefer to keep a relationship intact than burn a bridge. 
<br><br>
4. Actually listen. 
<br><br>
Super simple but when I meet someone several times and I can remember personal minutiae the other person really appreciates it, and are often shocked. We're often so focused on projecting that we miss what the other person is projecting. If you listen the other person can feel assured and appreciated. 
<br><br>
5. To have a friend, you have to be a friend.
<br><br>
Relationships are an exchange. Each person requires something from the situation, if they aren't they shouldn't be in the relationship. While there is a big focus on unconditional love, it is a silly concept, because it is a relationship that could be completely arbitrary and meaningless. Often what people label as unconditional love is completely conditional, the conditions are just so obvious that they blend into the background. But by striving for this false ideal, people invest too much energy in the arbitrary and the meaningless. Moreover, unconditional love begets unconditional hatred. Emphasis on the arbitrary bleeds into other emotions and enables a lot of nastiness. By thinking about a relationship as a reciprocal exchange (but in two sets of terms) the relationship remains meaningful - trust and love is earned through meaningful actions. Distrust is also earned and is not arbitrary. 
<br><br>
Trust and love are always vulnerable. Happiness is always vulnerable. There is always something valuable to lose. Many people fear loss more than they want to gain - they choose secure unhappiness over insecure happiness. For this reason, most people won't invest in being a friend first, they are waiting for the other person to move. Once you understand happiness is always insecure and accept it, it is pretty easy to be the friend first. So many people are just waiting to be met, but they require others to take the brunt of risk and be the friend first. Just do it. It's worth it. 
<br><br>
6. Smile.
<br><br>
Lower the energy barrier. That's it. 
<br><br>
7. There is no down-side of being polite. 
<br><br>
Some cultures require manners and politeness in conversation. In southeastern US, politeness is required for conversation. When southeastern folks go anywhere else in the country they are inhibited by the fact that they can only interact in such specific conditions. But if you understand this, being polite is appealing to everyone - for the folks that require it, they will immediately like you because you fit in their expectations. For the folks that don't require it, they will either be pleasantly surprised or slightly suspicious that you're sucking up. This also applies to smiling and being cheery - in Northern Europe and in the northeastern US people initially think these characteristics are fake. Once they are convinced it is real, these folks really appreciate it though. Happiness is like infectious energy, and when others people catch it, the energy is amplified. 
<br><br>
8. Respect boundaries. Never impose your own values onto others. 
<br><br>
The values you have are a product of your experiences. Others' values are a product of their experiences. Understand that there is a fundamental barrier between your perspective and others' perspectives because of this difference in experiences. Respect this boundary. When you impose your own values on others, you are not properly respecting the fact that the other person's values may be consistent with their experiences. Being aware of this boundary allows you to discuss very sensitive topics in a very comfortable way - if it is made clear that you respect others' perspectives and their body of experiences you will have a collaborative experience rather than an adversarial one.
<br><br>
9. Persuasion requires valuing the other side.
<br><br>
I think many Americans imagine persuasion as holding your adversary in a death-grip of self-righteousness until they've been throttled into seeing the truth. This interpretation is guaranteed to fail. Effective persuasion is being a necessary mirror for another person - understanding their argument to such a high degree that you can explain it and its flaws in their terms. I do not do the persuading - they persuade themselves - but I am the necessary messenger. To be the messenger requires valuing the other person's perspective over missionizing them. This is difficult, to understand someone else's perspective fully you first have to be completely open to the possibility that your views could be wrong. For this reason I invest my trust not in my specific views but in my meta-views (i.e. views about views). I value self-improvement. Self-improvement is a certain way of looking at the nature of my interpretations, that my current interpretations are flawed and that through a process of identifying failures I will improve. This meta-view enables me to be wrong: to be wrong is an opportunity to improve. Many Americans invest their sense of self-worth in a specific way of viewing an issue. Consequently they cannot take the risk to understand other interpretations - to fully understand, one must start with the humility that they could be wrong. Otherwise there will be ideological barriers that prevent them from understanding, barriers for ideological self-preservation. Being the messenger requires I understand their interpretation and their motivational structure (i.e. how they see their self-worth) so that I can present a counter-argument and a certain motivational structure for them to be motivated to be persuaded. If you present a reasonable counter-interpretation without motivation to be persuaded, they will simply reject your argument. You need to provide both. 
<br><br>
10. Emotions beget actions. Actions can also beget emotions. 
<br><br>
People are social animals and emotions are infectious. Happiness, sadness, and anxiety can all be passed to others. A big mistake a lot of folks make is not masking the fact they are sad or anxious. A lot of the time these folks are wallowing in the cheap gratification of self-pity and want others to either commiserate or care. For the most part, they won't.  They will either take advantage of you or avoid you like a leper. Both are bad. Both are highly risky and conflict with your objective. The way you solve your problem is by putting on a mask - be happy, be nice and others will be infected. And then you have a reason to be happy. Actions will beget complimentary emotions. 
<br><br>
11. Redraw barriers
<br><br>
When discussing very sensitive topics, redrawing barriers can reduce the chance of confrontation to zero. Confrontations occur when the one person gets defensive and thinks the other person is assaulting their views or their worth. A simple way of avoiding such feelings is to redraw the ideological barrier so that instead of it being between the two of you its around both of you: we are one team trying to figure something out. Confrontation becomes a collaboration. Much more effective. 
<br><br>
12. Eliminate filler words

<br><br>
<q>Um</q>, <q>like</q>, <q> you know? </q> eliminate these and many others from your vocabulary. It is better to say nothing than to fill space with useless language. Filler words will drop your perceived IQ by 15 points. Nobody wants this, least of all you. 
<br><br>
